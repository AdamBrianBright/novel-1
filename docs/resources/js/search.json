I know I'm not the fittest person in the world, but this low? And intelligence… Reminds me of good old RPGs I played. I guess it doesn't change my wits, only increases mana pool and my magic casting ability.","— I see. Well, despite it looking like a game, it is not. So staying alive is my priority. It doesn't tell how much defense will help. Also, this “impacts” could mean that it is not the only thing that counts towards protection.","— It works! I can use magic and without those stupid shouts!","— Screw it, I'll deal with this later. This panel looks like a console but activated with voice. Wait. Voice? Maybe I should only think about it?","— So increase vitality doesn't increase current health. Oh, right, it “determines the maximum”","— Strength, vitality, agility, dexterity is understandable. But how does defense work? Is it some sort of shield that covers my body? Or does it increase the strength of my skin?","— Wait, MP? Intelligence? Magic? Does this mean I can use it?","— Well, that was unexpected. Either I'm losing my mind or I ended up in one of those isekai things. If it's the last, then when I say things like “system” the panel should appear. No? Status?","— Well, that's enough for now. I need some food, water, and a place to sleep. Off we go!","— What? What's going on?","— Where the hell am I? I surely was… Was… Wait, where was I?","— Wind blade!— …— Maybe I should imagine it in my head?","' Attributes'","'Alright, Newt, stay calm.

They felt fresh, like he only dressed a moment ago.","He stood up from the ground just to see an unfamiliar place. Nothing reminded him of concrete jungles he used to be in.","In front of Newt's eyes popped a black box with white text on it. It was floating in midair.
